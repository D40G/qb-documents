Will you make it?

## Requirements
- QbCore framework (https://github.com/qbcore-framework)

## Setup
1.Add to qb-core/shared.lua
```
["usb_device"]	= {["name"] = "usb_device", ["label"] = "Unknown USB", ["weight"] = 0,	["type"] = "item", ["image"] = "usb_device.png", ["unique"] = true, ["useable"] = true, ["shouldClose"] = false, ["combinable"] = nil, ["description"] = "What do you do?"},
["governfiles"] = {["name"] = "governfiles", ["label"] = "Gov Files", ["weight"] = 0, ["type"] = "item", ["image"] = "governfiles.png", ["unique"] = true, ["useable"] = false, ["shouldClose"] = false, ["combinable"] = nil, ["description"] = "What is the worse that can happen?."},
